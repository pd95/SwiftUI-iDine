# SwiftUI-iDine

This Xcode project is created based on the "Hacking With Swift" tutorial for SwiftUI.
Specifically it follows the section "Building a complete project" of the 
[SwiftUI quick-start guide](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui), with the goal
to write a restaurant app that lists items in a menu and helps folks place orders.
